# X11
Everything related to X after started by either `startx` or some display manager.

General configurations independent of the window manager, for example:
- non WM keyboard shortcuts and keyboard layout preferences
- Compositor (I like transparency sometimes, like a teenager)
- Desktop backgrounds

Future me: `.xinitrc` and `.xprofile` are very similar, the difference is who loads them. Just modify `xprofile`.
